# Nexus-Coworking

In the upcoming future, work will no longer be located at a specific place, but a range of activities will be conducted virtually from anywhere and at any time. This paper gives a comprehensive view of these aspects and it is basically born out of the problems companies have with their workspaces. Workspace management is the process or strategy put into place by a company to improve efficiency, productivity, cost-cutting, and overall management in a workspace/ workplace or office setting. Workspace management covers a broad range of workspace considerations like equipment layout and space management, employee space optimization, future space planning, employee satisfaction, workplace environment, automation, and seamless workflows, overhead and cost, etc. Workplace managers work on both the mental and physical well-being of employees.
